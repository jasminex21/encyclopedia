    "title": "Linguistic Intergroup Bias",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What is Intergroup Bias?\nIntergroup bias refers to the systematic human tendency to exhibit favoritism towards one‚Äôs in-group over the out-group. This favoritism, or bias, may manifest in behaviour (e.g.¬†discrimination), attitude (e.g.¬†prejudice), and/or cognition (e.g.¬†stereotyping), and may take the form of in-group favoritism and/or out-group derogation.\nA key motivator of intergroup bias is Social Identity Theory (Tajfel 1979), which posits that humans derive a portion of their self-identity from their membership in social groups. Humans automatically categorize social groups into ‚Äúus‚Äù (the in-group) and ‚Äúthem‚Äù (the out-group) based on attributes such as race, gender, familial relation, or sports team allegiance, and then adopt the behaviours, norms, and values of the group. After identifying with a group, members compare their group to others, and exhibit positive distinctiveness - the process in which members of the in-group are inclined to make their group seem positively distinct from the out-group. As in, not only are the two groups different, the in-group also attempts to make this difference favorable.\nSocial categorization is strong. In fact, Tajfel (1970) demonstrated that mere categorization, even if trivial or nonsensical, is sufficient for in-group favoritism and out-group discrimination. In the study, it was found that British schoolboys categorized based on their preference between abstract artists Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky exhibited favoritism towards fellow schoolboys with the same preference, despite the insignificance of the social categorization. The participants were asked to assign points to members of both groups, and it was seen that they tended to do so in such a way that the difference between the two groups was maximized, even if this meant that the in-group overall had less points. In short, the very act of categorization is enough to trigger intergroup discrimination, and additionally, individuals desire to maximize the difference between the in-group and out-group.\n\n\n\nLinguistic Intergroup Bias\nNaturally, intergroup bias manifests in language. The linguistic intergroup bias (LIB) model, proposed by Anne Maass, describes how systematic biases reflected in language contribute to the perpetuation and persistence of stereotypes (Maass et al. 1989). Specifically, the LIB model highlights differences in levels of abstraction between in-group and out-group linguistics - positive behaviours displayed by in-group members are described in more abstract terms, whereas the same behaviours shown by an out-group member are described in more concrete terms. Inversely, negative behaviours are described more concretely when performed by an in-group member, but in more abstract terms when performed by an out-group member.\nThis differential can be explained by beliefs about the agent‚Äôs intrinsic nature, based on their group membership. Describing an observed behaviour abstractly implies that the action is perceived as stable and characteristic of the actor, since such descriptions imply greater generality and probability of future repetition. Concrete descriptions of behaviours, however, suggest that the action is an isolated or uncharacteristic event not necessarily linked to the actor‚Äôs enduring qualities. These gaps in levels of abstraction when describing the same action can unsurprisingly result in varying impressions on a hypothetical listener.\nIt is easy to see that such differential language can bolster existing stereotypes - it can be viewed as a self-perpetuating cycle where stereotype-congruent behaviours by the out-group are described in abstract terms that reinforce the prior (negative) expectations and perceptions of the out-group. Unexpected positive actions by the out-group are described in concrete terms, suggesting that they are uncharacteristic and are isolated events. These tendencies keep the unfavorable perception of the out-group intact. One can imagine especially how such differential language can have longstanding and consequential impacts in particular given the extensive use of social media in the modern age, which allows for the rapid dissemination of language in large volumes.\nAccording to Maass et al. (1989), two main explanations for the underlying mechanism for the LIB are 1) in-group protection, and 2) differential expectancy.\nThe former is motivated and based loosely on Tajfel‚Äôs Social Identity Theory (SIT) - it hypothesises that the LIB serves to protect or enhance one‚Äôs social identity. A key element of the SIT is positive distinctiveness, i.e., the desire for members of a group to portray the in-group as not only different, but different in a positive way, from the out-group. The LIB can be considered a potential strategy of maintaining a positive light of one‚Äôs in-group.\nThe second explanation suggests that the LIB may be a result of differential expectancy - variations in a speaker‚Äôs expectations of the behaviours of the in-group and out-group. Abstract language may be preferred when behaviours confirm prior expectations, while concrete language is preferred when unexpected or surprising behaviours are observed. Hence, because individuals tend to expect more desirable behaviours from their in-group, they naturally utilize abstract language when referring to the positive behaviours, and concrete language when referring to the unexpected negative behaviours.\n\n\nQuantifying Intergroup Bias\nMeasures of psychological valence, i.e., measures of the positivity of words, have been a longtime tool in the assessment of intergroup bias. Schmidtke and Kuperman (2024) used corpus-based lexical estimates of valence to investigate bias in intergroup scenarios. Participants were assigned to either the ‚Äúin-group‚Äù or ‚Äúout-group‚Äù conditions and were given a set of ‚Äúseed‚Äù words. In the ‚Äúin-group‚Äù condition, participants were told that the seed words described their in-group, and were asked to provide three more words to describe their group. Those in the ‚Äúout-group‚Äù condition were told that the seed words described an out-group, and were asked to provide three more words to describe that out-group. The intention of the experiment was to assess differences in valence in the words produced by participants of either group. To control the ‚Äúground truth,‚Äù the valence of the seed words were manipulated such that they ranged from highly positive to highly negative.\nIt was found, expectedly, that the valence of words directed towards the in-group was higher than that of words directed at the out-group. With regards to the seed ‚Äúground truth‚Äù valence, it was found that evaluations about the out-group were much closer to the seed valence, while evaluations about the in-group were consistently inflated. Furthermore, the magnitude of inflation from the ‚Äúground truth‚Äù tended to be larger when the valence of the seed words were more negative, suggesting that there is an implicit tendency to dissociate one‚Äôs in-group from negative characterizations.\nAs an extension to their first experiment, Schmidtke and Kuperman (2024) also examined the propagation of intergroup bias throughout successive generations. Using the linear difusion chain paradigm (which feeds responses of one generation to a next generation, who is given the same task, in this case of providing additional words based on seed words and group membership), it was found that there was a gradual increase in positivity in successive in-group generations, and a gradual decline in positivity in successive out-group generations. In short, intergroup bias is amplified across generations. As in the former experiment, the valence of the seed words did impact the magnitude of amplicifcation. For evaluations directed at the in-group, the positive inflation of generation was significant when the seed words were of low and mid valence, but not of high valence. For evaluations of directed at the out-group, the negative effect of generation was significant when the seed words were of mid and high valence, but not of low valence. Examination of the actual slopes of each model indicated that the desire to enhance initially negative descriptions of the in-group are stronger than the desire to derogate negative traits of the out-group.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nMaass, Anne, Daniela Salvi, Luciano Arcuri, and G√ºn R.

    "text": "The Link between Music Preference and Personality\nMany studies have found that there is indeed a connection (to some extent) between one‚Äôs music preferences and their personality traits. Several of these studies have yielded findings in support of interactionist theories, wherein people seek social contexts that provide them with self-confirmatory feedback (Swann Jr., Rentfrow, and Guinn 2003). As in, people intentionally select musical environments that reflect their psychological traits and needs.\nAnderson et al. (2021) conducted a study that aimed to gauge whether the Big Five personality traits could be predicted by music preference and music listening habits through machine learning.\n\nThe Big Five Personality Traits\nThe Big Five personality traits are a group of five key dimensions of personality, outlined by the Five Factor Model, that provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and summarizing human personality (Roccas et al. 2002). These traits are generally measured using self-report questionnaires, where respondants rate their agreement with various statements through a Likert scale.\nThe traits as described by John and Srivastava (1999):\n\nOpenness to experience: one‚Äôs willingness to try new things, and to engage in imaginative or intellectual activities. Those who score high in openness tend to be creative, intellectually curious, and open to new experiences, while low-scorers generally prefer routine and are uncomfortable with change.\nConscienciousness: one‚Äôs desire to take obligations and tasks seriously. This personality trait is defined by high levels of thoughtfulness, responsibility, and goal-oriented behaviours. Those who score high in conscientiousness are usually considerate, self-disciplined, goal-oriented, and have good impulse control, whereas low-scorers struggle to complete tasks due to poor impulse control.\nExtraversion: one‚Äôs tendency to seek (usually social) interaction with their environment. This manifests in outgoing, energetic, and talkative behaviours. Those high in extraversion (i.e., are extroverts) are sociable and are energized by social interaction, whereas those low in extraversion (i.e., are introverts) are reserved, reflective, happy in solitude, and may feel fatigued from social interaction.\nAgreeableness: one‚Äôs tendency to act in a cooperative, unselfish manner. Highly agreeable people are sensitive to the needs of others, and are described as trustworthy, sympathetic, and considerate. Those low in agreeableness may be perceived as competitive, uncooperative, and even manipulative.\nNeuroticism: describes one‚Äôs emotional stability - it takes into account how likely a person is to interpret events as threatening or difficult, as well as one‚Äôs propensity for negative emotions. Those scoring high in neuroticism tend to be lower in self-esteem and more anxious and irritable, while those low in neuroticism are calm, secure, resilient, and self-satisfied.\n\n\nThis study involved over 17.6 million streams (662,000 hours of music) listened to by 5,808 users on Spotify over a 3-month period. Information about user demography, musical preferences, and listening habits were collected to use as input to the machine learning model.\nThe input features are described as follows:\n\nGenre and mood vectors: Each users‚Äô listening data was mapped to two vectors: genre and mood vectors. Spotify generates its genre labels internally, using a combination of aggregated listening patterns (clusters of user behavior), audio features, and cultural knowledge. To produce the mood vectors, the researchers used a third-party service called Gracenote, which analyzes the audio signals of each song - features like rhythm and harmony - and uses a classifier to assign a mood label to the track. 66 Spotify genres and 25 Gracenote moods were represented across all study participants. Each users‚Äô streams were mapped to these genres and moods, and then aggregated and normalized to get the percentage of listening from each genre or mood.\n\nEach user ends up with a length 66 genre vector, and a length 25 mood vector, where each element in either vector indicates the percentage of that user‚Äôs listening data attributed to each genre or mood. E.g., say my genre vector looked something like [0.63, 0.24, 0.04, 0.09, 0, ‚Ä¶ 0], where the corresponding genres are [metalcore, pop punk, pop, rap, &lt;everything else&gt;].\n\n\nDerived metrics: Features were constructed using data provided by Spotify that describes user behaviour on the platform. These features included simpler ones such as the user‚Äôs type of device (e.g., Mac, game console) and number of playlists, as well as computed features that descibe four aspects of user listening behaviour, namely:\n\nDiscovery: indicates how open a user is to exploring new music. When considering the first time a user listens to a song as when they ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù the song, researchers computed users‚Äô historical discovery rate (total number of unique songs / total number of streams) and windowed discovery rate (the percentage of new songs across listening in the last 30 days). However, discovery rate is not consistent - people tend to have periods of discovery interspersed amongst periods of low discovery (i.e., listening to familiar songs). So, researchers also calculated the historical spread of the windowed discovery rate (how much variation there is in a user‚Äôs discovery rate over time), as well as the difference between the current and historical rates of discovery.\nDiversity: a quantification of how diverse a user‚Äôs music taste is. This was computed by projecting songs into multidimensional space based on co-occurrences in other user-generated playlists. Songs that are often added together in playlists are closer to each other, while songs that don‚Äôt often co-occur have more distance between them. If a user listens to songs that are far apart in this space, this indicates that their music taste is more diverse. The researchers measured aggregate diversity (aggregate distance the user has traversed in the space) and sequential diversity (the average distance between one song and the next) over daily and monthly windows. Standard deviation of the daily windows was also measured to indicate how each user‚Äôs diversity changes from day to day.\nContextual listening and audio features: determines what a user‚Äôs typical audio fingerprint is, and whether it changes based on context. For example, someone may listen to jazz on weekdays and metal on weekends. A measure called the Shannon Entropy was computed to descibe how each user distributes their listening across different contents (genre, mood, or audio attributes) or contexts (time of day or week).\nNostalgia: denotes a user‚Äôs tendency to listen to music representative of their formative years. A metric was computed to describe for each user how much they listen to music that is characteristic of and relevant to their generation.\n\nProduct flag: Spotify has a free version and a Premium version, where the free tier is available without charge but comes with restrictions such as no on-demand streaming and limited numbers of skips. The Premium version gives users unlimited access to their music. These differences impact how the user engages with Spotify, so this feature indicates whether each user has Spotify for free or Spotify Premium.\n\nThe target variables for this study were the Big Five personality Traits, which were measured for each participant via the Big Five Inventory, a 44-item (Likert-style) questionnaire that measures the five traits.\nThe goal of the machine learning model was to independently predict numerical values of each of the Big Five personality traits, given a user‚Äôs features. Model selection was done with consideration of the concern of overfitting caused by the large number of features (there were 211, including all genre, mood, demographic, and derived features). Using regularized methods is a common means of addressing overfitting - it does so by penalizing the model coefficients that cause the overfitting (more technically, by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which ultimately punishes overly complex models).\n\nLasso and Ridge Regression\n\nL1 or lasso regression adds the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients to the cost function, which can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero, essentially excluding less important features (feature selection).\nL2 or ridge regression adds the sum of the square of each coefficient to the cost function, which encourages the model to keep coefficients small while not completely eliminating them. Ridge regularization is especially useful when features are correlated, because it distributes their influence across the features.\n\n\nResearchers in this study chose elastic net regularization regression, which combines the strengths of lasso and ridge regression to address datasets with large numbers of features while also outperforming lasso and ridge regression individually (Zou and Hastie 2005). Additionally, random forest regression was also used to account for potentially nonlinear relationships between predictors, such as differences in personality traits amongst Spotify Free and Premium users.\nFor each model, 10-fold cross-validation in which all variable selection and parameter tuning was done within each training set independently, was used to ensure robust results. Prediction accuracy was measured by computing the Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted values (for each personality trait) and the actual measured values for the test group of each fold. The final reported results are the average correlations across each fold.\n\nThe results that each of the Big Five traits are predicted by musical preferences and habitual listening behaviours with moderate to high accuracy. Conscienciousness and emotional stabilty (opposite of neuroticism) were found to be the two most predictable traits. The Pearson correlation coefficients are shown in the below table.\n\nThere were several interesting correlations between personality traits and certain genres or moods:\n\nOpenness: positively correlated with Atmospheric, Folk, Reggae, or Afropop, which are less popular genres, as well as ‚Äúsentimental‚Äù or ‚Äúmelancholy‚Äù music\nEmotional stability: positively correlated with Blues, Old Country, Soul, and ‚Äúlively‚Äù music, and negatively correlated with Indie, Emo, and Regional Music from Korea, as well as with ‚Äúbrooding‚Äù (e.g., Take Care by Drake; Karma Police by Radiohead) or ‚ÄúDefiant‚Äù music (e.g., Mask Off by Future and 3005 by Childish Gambino).\nAgreeableness: positively correlated with Jazz, Soul, and ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù music (e.g., Fly Me to the Moon by Frank Sinatra), and negatively correlated with Punk, Death metal, or other ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù music.\nConscientiousness: positively correlated with Funk, Easy Listening, or ‚ÄúRomantic‚Äù music (e.g., La Vie en Rose by Edith Piaf), and negatively correlated with Rock, Comedy, and Alternative genres, as well as with ‚ÄúEnergizing‚Äù (e.g., Happy by Pharrell Williams) and ‚ÄúExcited‚Äù (e.g., California Gurls by Katy Perry) moods.\nExtraversion: positively correlated with Funk, Reggaeton, or ‚Äúsensual‚Äù music (e.g., Same Old Love by Selena Gomez), and negatively correlated with Rock, Metal, and ‚Äúurgent‚Äù music (e.g., Locked Out of Heaven by Bruno Mars; Cheap Thrills by Sia)\n\nThere were also correlations between the derived metrics and personality traits:\n\nEmotional stability correlated negatively with average skip rate, indicating that those who were more neurotic tended to be more selective of what they listened to at any given moment.\nOpenness correlated positively with all-time track discovery rate and genre entropy, indicating predictably that high scorers in Openness are more willing to explore new music and different types of music.\nThose scoring high in Conscienciousness tended to concentrate their listening to a narrow window of time in the day across multiple weeks, indicating they structure their day more rigidly than lower scorers.\nThose high in Extraversion tended to listen more from others‚Äô playlists, which can have many possible explanations. For example, they may be more reliant on their social networks‚Äô music suggestions, or they may prefer to discover new music based on their friend group.\nThose who listened to more Spotify-suggested music tended to score higher in Agreeableness or Conscientiousness.",

    "text": "Conclusion & Insights (self-study)\nI decided to take the Big Five personality test so I could see if the paper‚Äôs findings generally align with what I know about myself. I took the online test from Truity (link here) and another from bigfive-web (link here) for cross-validation purposes. The former was 50 questions, while the latter was 120 (questions were more detailed).\nHere are my results from Truity (100-scale):\n\nAnd here are my results from bigfive-web (120-scale):\n\nIn summary from bigfive-web, I score high in all categories except for Extraversion. This is in agreement with the Truity scores, though perhaps a bit less extreme. I‚Äôm more willing to trust the bigfive-web results, since the questions were more detailed and I do think I put more thought into them. However, the questionnaire used in the study had less than 50 questions, so in terms of reliability and consistency, I‚Äôll still keep the Truity scores in mind.\nbigfive-web also gives detailed breakdowns of individual aspects of each personality trait and how I score in them. You can review that by downloading the PDF here.\nHere‚Äôs how I align (or don‚Äôt align) with the study findings. Quick note that the study uses Emotional Stability instead of Neuroticism, and high Neuroticism (me) = low Emotional Stability:\n\nOpenness (high):\n\nPositive correlation with genre entropy (aligns): I think I‚Äôd agree with this. Although I listen mostly to metalcore, rock, and pop punk, I mix in some rap / hip-hop and pop. I like the occasional Joyner Lucas and Pop Smoke to hype me up before big events and also the classic pop ‚Äúwhite girl bangers‚Äù (Katy Perry, Kesha) in the car on the way to the gym. Jazz shows up at times as well when I‚Äôm practicing saxophone or just chilling.\nPositive correlation with # of playlists made by user (aligns): I have over 140 playlists - I think that‚Äôs a lot. They denote different genres, artists, moods, or feelings for me, and I love making them.\nPositive correlation with all time # of unique tracks and artists (aligns): I imagine these numbers are pretty high, but I‚Äôm not sure what is considered ‚Äúhigh‚Äù in the study. I‚Äôve streamed over 1.5K unique songs from 400-500 unique artists each year from 2022 to 2024 (numbers from lastfm).\nPositive correlation with ‚Äúmelancholy,‚Äù ‚Äúsomber,‚Äù ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù moods (does not align): I don‚Äôt think I listen to a lot songs with these moods. ‚ÄúPeaceful‚Äù maybe, due to my study music (Novo Amor, Portair).\n\nConscienciousness (high):\n\nPositive correlations with Country, Blues, Soul, and Funk genres, and negative correlations with Rock, Alternative, and any ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù music (does not align): I appear to be inversely correlated to those trends.\n\nAgreeableness (high):\n\nPositive correlations with Jazz, Soul, Funk genres and ‚Äúromantic‚Äù and ‚Äúsentimental‚Äù moods, and negative correlations with Punk, Emo, Metal, Alternative, and Rock genres, as well as any ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù music (does not align): same as with Conscienciousness - I clearly don‚Äôt align much here.\n\nEmotional stability (low):\n\nNegative correlations with Emo, Punk, Modern Rock, Indie, Alternative, and Rock genres (aligns): yeah this describes my music taste pretty well.\n\nExtraversion (low):\n\nPositive correlation with % of mobile listening from others‚Äô playlists (aligns): I pretty much only listen to my own playlists.\nNegative correlation with Punk, Rock, Gothic, Emo, Death Metal, Metal, Alternative, Modern Rock, and ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù music (aligns): funny how introverted people like loud music. This aligns very well with my taste.\n\n\nTo conclude, there are lots of fascinating trends and patterns revealed by Anderson et al. (2021). While I resonate with several, there are obviously many where I don‚Äôt align, which makes sense, because human behaviour is difficult to generalize. I do find it very interesting how louder, aggressive music (much of my current music taste) can predict higher Neuroticism and lower Extraversion - I wonder why that is, and it may be worthy of a future deep dive. There are also lots of other factors not directly related to personality that can influence music preference, such as culture, age, and situational factors, that can be further explored.\nTo answer my intial question of whether changes in my personality helped drive my changes in music taste, I‚Äôm not sure I can draw any sort of conclusions on that. I‚Äôve absolutely become more open-minded over the years, which is what drew me to listen to new music in the first place, hence helping me realize I really like metalcore and aggressive music. I believe I‚Äôve become more emotionally secure and extraverted over time as well, which, based on the study, might push me away from louder music. However, introvertedness and neuroticism does run in the family, and it‚Äôs likely not something I can change in myself for good, so perhaps I always would have liked the music I like now, if I‚Äôd been open enough back then to discover it.",

    "text": "How to be more likable\nResearch has shown that a huge part of why certain people are deemed ‚Äúpopular‚Äù or more ‚Äúlikable‚Äù is simply because they themselves like more people. For example, simply saying hi to people you know whilst passing by helps them perceive you as more likable, because you like them. Make people feel so liked that they like you back. To facilitate this, three magic phrases for likeability (use as much as desired):\n\n‚ÄúI was just thinking of you!‚Äù / ‚Äú&lt;X&gt;, and it reminded me of you!‚Äù\n\nCan be used as a transition into a ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù\nLet this occur naturally - e.g., if you watch a documentary and it reminds you of someone, text that person and let them know.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always so &lt;X&gt;‚Äù\n\nGive the other party a positive label. This is especially effective because it fights signal amplification bias (people don‚Äôt always know what you think of them!).\n\n‚ÄúLast time we talked, you mentioned &lt;X&gt;‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nCan be used like ‚ÄúHey, the last time we talked, you mentioned that big project you were really excited about, how‚Äôs that going?‚Äù\nPeople are honored when you remember stuff about them.",

    "section": "How to be CHARISMATIC",
    "text": "How to be CHARISMATIC\nTo be charismatic, you have to be highly competent and highly warm, and more importantly, you need to signal that you are highly competent and highly warm. People cannot trust you if you do not send enough competency or warmth cues.\nA preface: gestures are massive in charisma. When speaking to someone, make sure your hands are always available to gesture. The significance of gestures is that they help indicate honesty and competency, and they also contribute to vocal intonations and variety (if you sit on your hands during a conversation or interview, the amount of your vocal intonations and variety will automatically decrease).\n\nPower cues of competence\nCompetence = power, reliability, and capability. How to channel competence through cues:\n\nThe steeple gesture (i.e.¬†making a triangle with your hands).\n\nFound to be the highest-ranked gesture that leaders use.\nShows you are not hiding anything, yet you are relaxed and poised.\nDo NOT drum your hands / fingers.\n\nMaximize the distance between your earlobe and shoulder.\n\nThis distance is correlated with confidence; high shoulders indicates anxiety (and also prevents you from using full vocal power). People do not like anxious people. Relax your shoulders down, keep your earlobes out. This makes you both look more confident and feel more confident.\n\nMake eye contact at the end of your sentences, and ideally when the other person is making an important point.\n\nMaintaining 100% eye contact in a conversation feels invasive and awkward; 60-70% is more ideal.\nPeople like when you process and gather information or memories from all around, but then look back at them at the end of the sentence to drill a point.\n\nUsing and noticing the lower lid flex.\n\nWhen you are trying to see something far away, you harden your lower lid to try and see it better (basically squinting). When you are really trying to focus on something, they flex their lower lid - people like this, because it shows that you are focused on what they are saying.\nNote that this is not an inherently positive cue - it is a cue of focus, and is also important to notice when people are doing it (in addition to you yourself using it). So, if you are, say, presenting something, and someone flexes their lower lid, you can follow up with them and ask ‚Äúdoes this make sense?‚Äù and try to gather more information and clarify concerns. This allows you to prevent skepticism and confusion.\n\nUsing downward vocal inflections, and preventing accidental question inflections.\n\nVocal cues are crucial because they tell people how you feel about them, and how you feel about yourself.\nThe question inflection is when your tone goes up at the end of a sentence, like you are asking a question. Do NOT use the question inflection when you are not asking a question, because it makes people doubt and scrutinize you. In fact, people tend to use it when telling a lie.\nImportantly, do NOT ask your name when you introduce yourself. You want to be perceived as confident when making a first impression.\nGo DOWN at the end of sentences - this makes people think that you really belieave in what you are saying, and they will take you seriously.\n\n\n\n\nPower cues of warmth\nWarmth = trust, likeability, and friendliness. Pay close attention to these if you‚Äôve been told you‚Äôre hard to talk to, intimidating, or cold, or if people don‚Äôt tend to open up to you. How to channel warmth through cues:\n\nA slow triple nod.\n\nThis draws people to tell you more - research has shown that the slow triple nod makes people talk longer.\nDo NOT bobble-head, and do NOT nod too quickly, because nodding too quickly implies impatience, and is basically telling the other person to stfu.\n\nHead tilt.\n\nTilting your head makes you look like you are listening and that you care.\nResearch has shown that if you tilt your head when delivering bad news, you are more likable - people take the news better.\nThis is good to use if you nod too much.\n\nAn authentic smile.\n\nAn authentic, genuine smile should reach all the way up to your eyes and hit your cheek muscles. Genuine happiness is contagious.\nFake smiles arhave the same effect as not smiling at all.\n\nLean forward, both as a speaker and a listener.\n\nIf someone is leaning towards you, it makes you feel closer to them.\nYou can lean in as a speaker if you want to emphasize an important point - lean slightly towards the other person to use it as a bold or a highlight. BUT, don‚Äôt lean all the time, because highlighting an entire page of a book means nothing.\nYou can lean in as a listener when the other person says something of interest, to show that you are engaged.\nToo much of a lean implies that you are subservient and submissive to the other person (it looks like a bow), and people want equal relationships.\n\nNonverbal bridging - physically bridge the distance between yourself and the other person.\n\nIn impactful conversations, people try to bridge the distance between themselves and the other speaker via bridges like leaning in, hand gestures, nods, drinks, and when close enough, light physical touches on the arm or shoulder. The warmest people are bridging all the time. You are reaching into the other person‚Äôs intimate zone, but not staying there.\nYou can even touch without touching - you can hover above the arm / shoulder and then go back.\nClosing bridges is a very warm action - this is why serving or giving people things is so warm.",

    "text": "Questions to level up with people\n\n‚ÄúAre you working on anything exciting recently / these days?‚Äù\n\nStop asking boring questions like ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat do you do?‚Äù - this puts people on autopilot.\nAsking someone ‚Äúwhat do you do?‚Äù can actually be perceived as rude if that person is not defined by their work.\nThis is permission connection - if someone is defined by what they do, they will tell you about what they do. If they are not defined by what they do, they‚Äôll tell you something better.\nThe responses to this question also gives you something to bring up when you next see the person - you can start the conversation with ‚Äúhey, last time we spoke, you mentioned you were working on &lt;X&gt; - how‚Äôs that been going?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your biggest goal right now?‚Äù\n\nThis is a great question to ask, especially around the new year (Janurary - March).\nGenerally, when you ask this question, people will either 1) shut you down, or 2) talk about their goals. Anyone who shuts you down, saying they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt believe in goals‚Äù is probably not your person.\nThis is another question that is great to follow up on.\n\n‚ÄúWhat book, movie, or TV character is most like you, and why?‚Äù\n\nThis is a deeper question that helps you figure out the other person‚Äôs narrative, and the response to this question is so important, because how someone relates to characters (their values or personality) is how they see themselves.\n(For future reference, my answer to this question would be Riley from Inside Out)",

    "text": "How to improve your dating life\n\nSocial media presence\nYour social media presence should activate the correct neural networks for the right partner and create ‚Äúallergies‚Äù in others (you don‚Äôt want to appeal to everyone, because you don‚Äôt want to waste your time with the wrong people).\n\nE.g., do NOT overwhelm your Instagram with photos at bars and at parties if your intention is to settle down and have a family with someone.\nE.g., if you want to attract a hard worker, post photos of yourself at conferences and working hard yourself.\n\nYour main profile picture should signal warmth and competence.\n\n\nBody language\nUse your body language to signal that you are confident. Maximize the distance between your earlobe and shoulder, and the distance between your arm and your torso should fluctuate.\n\nIn a good conversation, the distance between the arm and torso fluctuates a lot. People who are anxious are contracted; their arms are stuck to their torso at all times and they have minimal hand gestures. Releasing that space makes you appear more confident and less anxious, and aids with vocal variety.\n\nDo NOT accidentally use vocal fry. People who are contracted also may tend to use vocal fry, which occurs when you are out of breath, causing the vocal chords to rattle. If you hear yourself using it, speak louder.\n\n\nMen and women perceive body language differently - in women, far more brain regions were activated than in men when looking at pictures of body language. Women take in a much broader pictures of body language, while men tend to be more cue-focused. Women tend to globalize cues and over-generalize.\n\n\nHow to get approached\nResearch has shown that people who get approached the most [in clubs] gave out the biggest signals of availability - these people did not necessarily have to be the most attractive. How to signal you are available:\n\nOpen body with no blocking your torso.\n\nNothing should be in front of your torso - do NOT cross your arms, clutch your phone / computer, etc. Keep your torso open and angled out to the room.\nYour feet should also be angled toward the biggest part of the room, signaling you are open. Not parallel feet.\n\nSmall, darting glances to everyone in the room (who you want to approach you).\n\nYou actually need to glance (quickly) at a person ~8 times to get them to approach - a higher number than you probably would‚Äôve expected.\nThese glances should be quick; things like side glances, a side glance with a smile, a flip of the hair and a look over.\n\nGenerally gesturing in the person of interest‚Äôs direction.\n\nWhen talking to someone else, gesture in the person of interest‚Äôs line of gesturing, almost signalling for them to come over. If that person is at all interested, they are likely to come over.\n\n\nPay close attention to the responses to your gestures. If the person meets your glance, that‚Äôs good. If the person turns away from you or turns their feet away from you, they are probably not very receptive to your advances.\nGenerally, people are lonely and really want to meet their person and make friends.",

    "text": "How to spot a liar\nThe average person is very bad at spotting a liar, so do not overestimate your ability to do so. Give people the benefit of the doubt. But, that being said, there are cues that repeatedly show up in people who are lying:\n\nVerbal cues:\n\nSudden use of the question inflection.\n\nIf you hear that, especially in a statement, number, timeline, or boundary, it‚Äôs a sign for you to dig deeper to see if you hear it again.\n\nA sudden drop in volume.\n\nWhen people are anxious or nervous, we lose breath and our volume drops.\nIf you hear this, it‚Äôs a signal for you to dig deeper.\n\n\nNonverbal cues:\n\nIncongruencies where the verbal does not match the body.\n\nThe biggest examples of this is when someone is saying yes but shakes their head no, or when they say no and nod their head yes. People don‚Äôt often realize they are shaking their head no whilst saying yes - it is actively difficult to think about what you are saying and what you are doing separately. (Note, though, that there are cultural exceptions in India, Bulgaria, and Pakistan - they nod differently)\n\nMismatched facial expressions, typically disgust.\n\nDisgust is typically denoted by people crinkling their nose and sometimes flashing their upper teeth.\nLiars often feel ‚Äúdirty‚Äù with themselves for lying, and so they‚Äôll show disgust when lying.\nLiars may sometimes sniff when lying as well - it is a disgust activator.\nYou can also use this cue as a speaker - if you see someone making a disgusted facial expression in response to something you‚Äôre saying, take it as a sign to go back on it.",
