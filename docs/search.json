To facilitate this, three magic phrases for likeability (use as much as desired):\n\n“I was just thinking of you!” / “&lt;X&gt;, and it reminded me of you!”\n\nCan be used as a transition into a “how are you?”\nLet this occur naturally - e.g., if you watch a documentary and it reminds you of someone, text that person and let them know.\n\n“You’re always so &lt;X&gt;”\n\nGive the other party a positive label. This is especially effective because it fights signal amplification bias (people don’t always know what you think of them!).\n\n“Last time we talked, you mentioned &lt;X&gt;…”\n\nCan be used like “Hey, the last time we talked, you mentioned that big project you were really excited about, how’s that going?”\nPeople are honored when you remember stuff about them.",

    "text": "How to be CHARISMATIC\nTo be charismatic, you have to be highly competent and highly warm, and more importantly, you need to signal that you are highly competent and highly warm. People cannot trust you if you do not send enough competency or warmth cues.\nA preface: gestures are massive in charisma. When speaking to someone, make sure your hands are always available to gesture. The significance of gestures is that they help indicate honesty and competency, and they also contribute to vocal intonations and variety (if you sit on your hands during a conversation or interview, the amount of your vocal intonations and variety will automatically decrease).\n\nPower cues of competence\nCompetence = power, reliability, and capability. How to channel competence through cues:\n\nThe steeple gesture (i.e. making a triangle with your hands).\n\nFound to be the highest-ranked gesture that leaders use.\nShows you are not hiding anything, yet you are relaxed and poised.\nDo NOT drum your hands / fingers.\n\nMaximize the distance between your earlobe and shoulder.\n\nThis distance is correlated with confidence; high shoulders indicates anxiety (and also prevents you from using full vocal power). People do not like anxious people. Relax your shoulders down, keep your earlobes out. This makes you both look more confident and feel more confident.\n\nMake eye contact at the end of your sentences, and ideally when the other person is making an important point.\n\nMaintaining 100% eye contact in a conversation feels invasive and awkward; 60-70% is more ideal.\nPeople like when you process and gather information or memories from all around, but then look back at them at the end of the sentence to drill a point.\n\nUsing and noticing the lower lid flex.\n\nWhen you are trying to see something far away, you harden your lower lid to try and see it better (basically squinting). When you are really trying to focus on something, they flex their lower lid - people like this, because it shows that you are focused on what they are saying.\nNote that this is not an inherently positive cue - it is a cue of focus, and is also important to notice when people are doing it (in addition to you yourself using it). So, if you are, say, presenting something, and someone flexes their lower lid, you can follow up with them and ask “does this make sense?” and try to gather more information and clarify concerns. This allows you to prevent skepticism and confusion.\n\nUsing downward vocal inflections, and preventing accidental question inflections.\n\nVocal cues are crucial because they tell people how you feel about them, and how you feel about yourself.\nThe question inflection is when your tone goes up at the end of a sentence, like you are asking a question. Do NOT use the question inflection when you are not asking a question, because it makes people doubt and scrutinize you. In fact, people tend to use it when telling a lie.\nImportantly, do NOT ask your name when you introduce yourself. You want to be perceived as confident when making a first impression.\nGo DOWN at the end of sentences - this makes people think that you really belieave in what you are saying, and they will take you seriously.\n\n\n\n\nPower cues of warmth\nWarmth = trust, likeability, and friendliness. Pay close attention to these if you’ve been told you’re hard to talk to, intimidating, or cold, or if people don’t tend to open up to you. How to channel warmth through cues:\n\nA slow triple nod.\n\nThis draws people to tell you more - research has shown that the slow triple nod makes people talk longer.\nDo NOT bobble-head, and do NOT nod too quickly, because nodding too quickly implies impatience, and is basically telling the other person to stfu.\n\nHead tilt.\n\nTilting your head makes you look like you are listening and that you care.\nResearch has shown that if you tilt your head when delivering bad news, you are more likable - people take the news better.\nThis is good to use if you nod too much.\n\nAn authentic smile.\n\nAn authentic, genuine smile should reach all the way up to your eyes and hit your cheek muscles. Genuine happiness is contagious.\nFake smiles arhave the same effect as not smiling at all.\n\nLean forward, both as a speaker and a listener.\n\nIf someone is leaning towards you, it makes you feel closer to them.\nYou can lean in as a speaker if you want to emphasize an important point - lean slightly towards the other person to use it as a bold or a highlight. BUT, don’t lean all the time, because highlighting an entire page of a book means nothing.\nYou can lean in as a listener when the other person says something of interest, to show that you are engaged.\nToo much of a lean implies that you are subservient and submissive to the other person (it looks like a bow), and people want equal relationships.\n\nNonverbal bridging - physically bridge the distance between yourself and the other person.\n\nIn impactful conversations, people try to bridge the distance between themselves and the other speaker via bridges like leaning in, hand gestures, nods, drinks, and when close enough, light physical touches on the arm or shoulder. The warmest people are bridging all the time. You are reaching into the other person’s intimate zone, but not staying there.\nYou can even touch without touching - you can hover above the arm / shoulder and then go back.\nClosing bridges is a very warm action - this is why serving or giving people things is so warm.",

If they are not defined by what they do, they’ll tell you something better.\nThe responses to this question also gives you something to bring up when you next see the person - you can start the conversation with “hey, last time we spoke, you mentioned you were working on &lt;X&gt; - how’s that been going?”\n\n“What’s your biggest goal right now?”\n\nThis is a great question to ask, especially around the new year (Janurary - March).\nGenerally, when you ask this question, people will either 1) shut you down, or 2) talk about their goals. Anyone who shuts you down, saying they “don’t believe in goals” is probably not your person.\nThis is another question that is great to follow up on.\n\n“What book, movie, or TV character is most like you, and why?”\n\nThis is a deeper question that helps you figure out the other person’s narrative, and the response to this question is so important, because how someone relates to characters (their values or personality) is how they see themselves.\n(For future reference, my answer to this question would be Riley from Inside Out)",

    "text": "How to improve your dating life\n\nSocial media presence\nYour social media presence should activate the correct neural networks for the right partner and create “allergies” in others (you don’t want to appeal to everyone, because you don’t want to waste your time with the wrong people).\n\nE.g., do NOT overwhelm your Instagram with photos at bars and at parties if your intention is to settle down and have a family with someone.\nE.g., if you want to attract a hard worker, post photos of yourself at conferences and working hard yourself.\n\nYour main profile picture should signal warmth and competence.\n\n\nBody language\nUse your body language to signal that you are confident. Maximize the distance between your earlobe and shoulder, and the distance between your arm and your torso should fluctuate.\n\nIn a good conversation, the distance between the arm and torso fluctuates a lot. People who are anxious are contracted; their arms are stuck to their torso at all times and they have minimal hand gestures. Releasing that space makes you appear more confident and less anxious, and aids with vocal variety.\n\nDo NOT accidentally use vocal fry. People who are contracted also may tend to use vocal fry, which occurs when you are out of breath, causing the vocal chords to rattle. If you hear yourself using it, speak louder.\n\n\nMen and women perceive body language differently - in women, far more brain regions were activated than in men when looking at pictures of body language. Women take in a much broader pictures of body language, while men tend to be more cue-focused. Women tend to globalize cues and over-generalize.\n\n\nHow to get approached\nResearch has shown that people who get approached the most [in clubs] gave out the biggest signals of availability - these people did not necessarily have to be the most attractive. How to signal you are available:\n\nOpen body with no blocking your torso.\n\nNothing should be in front of your torso - do NOT cross your arms, clutch your phone / computer, etc. Keep your torso open and angled out to the room.\nYour feet should also be angled toward the biggest part of the room, signaling you are open. Not parallel feet.\n\nSmall, darting glances to everyone in the room (who you want to approach you).\n\nYou actually need to glance (quickly) at a person ~8 times to get them to approach - a higher number than you probably would’ve expected.\nThese glances should be quick; things like side glances, a side glance with a smile, a flip of the hair and a look over.\n\nGenerally gesturing in the person of interest’s direction.\n\nWhen talking to someone else, gesture in the person of interest’s line of gesturing, almost signalling for them to come over. If that person is at all interested, they are likely to come over.\n\n\nPay close attention to the responses to your gestures. If the person meets your glance, that’s good. If the person turns away from you or turns their feet away from you, they are probably not very receptive to your advances.\nGenerally, people are lonely and really want to meet their person and make friends.",

People don’t often realize they are shaking their head no whilst saying yes - it is actively difficult to think about what you are saying and what you are doing separately. (Note, though, that there are cultural exceptions in India, Bulgaria, and Pakistan - they nod differently)\n\nMismatched facial expressions, typically disgust.\n\nDisgust is typically denoted by people crinkling their nose and sometimes flashing their upper teeth.\nLiars often feel “dirty” with themselves for lying, and so they’ll show disgust when lying.\nLiars may sometimes sniff when lying as well - it is a disgust activator.\nYou can also use this cue as a speaker - if you see someone making a disgusted facial expression in response to something you’re saying, take it as a sign to go back on it.",

    "title": "Linguistic Intergroup Bias",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What is Intergroup Bias?\nIntergroup bias refers to the systematic human tendency to exhibit favoritism towards one’s in-group over the out-group. This favoritism, or bias, may manifest in behaviour (e.g. discrimination), attitude (e.g. prejudice), and/or cognition (e.g. stereotyping), and may take the form of in-group favoritism and/or out-group derogation.\nA key motivator of intergroup bias is Social Identity Theory (Tajfel 1979), which posits that humans derive a portion of their self-identity from their membership in social groups. Humans automatically categorize social groups into “us” (the in-group) and “them” (the out-group) based on attributes such as race, gender, familial relation, or sports team allegiance, and then adopt the behaviours, norms, and values of the group. After identifying with a group, members compare their group to others, and exhibit positive distinctiveness - the process in which members of the in-group are inclined to make their group seem positively distinct from the out-group. As in, not only are the two groups different, the in-group also attempts to make this difference favorable.\nSocial categorization is strong. In fact, Tajfel (1970) demonstrated that mere categorization, even if trivial or nonsensical, is sufficient for in-group favoritism and out-group discrimination. In the study, it was found that British schoolboys categorized based on their preference between abstract artists Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky exhibited favoritism towards fellow schoolboys with the same preference, despite the insignificance of the social categorization. The participants were asked to assign points to members of both groups, and it was seen that they tended to do so in such a way that the difference between the two groups was maximized, even if this meant that the in-group overall had less points. In short, the very act of categorization is enough to trigger intergroup discrimination, and additionally, individuals desire to maximize the difference between the in-group and out-group.\n\n\n\nLinguistic Intergroup Bias\nNaturally, intergroup bias manifests in language. The linguistic intergroup bias (LIB) model, proposed by Anne Maass, describes how systematic biases reflected in language contribute to the perpetuation and persistence of stereotypes (Maass et al. 1989). Specifically, the LIB model highlights differences in levels of abstraction between in-group and out-group linguistics - positive behaviours displayed by in-group members are described in more abstract terms, whereas the same behaviours shown by an out-group member are described in more concrete terms. Inversely, negative behaviours are described more concretely when performed by an in-group member, but in more abstract terms when performed by an out-group member.\nThis differential can be explained by beliefs about the agent’s intrinsic nature, based on their group membership. Describing an observed behaviour abstractly implies that the action is perceived as stable and characteristic of the actor, since such descriptions imply greater generality and probability of future repetition. Concrete descriptions of behaviours, however, suggest that the action is an isolated or uncharacteristic event not necessarily linked to the actor’s enduring qualities. These gaps in levels of abstraction when describing the same action can unsurprisingly result in varying impressions on a hypothetical listener.\nIt is easy to see that such differential language can bolster existing stereotypes - it can be viewed as a self-perpetuating cycle where stereotype-congruent behaviours by the out-group are described in abstract terms that reinforce the prior (negative) expectations and perceptions of the out-group. Unexpected positive actions by the out-group are described in concrete terms, suggesting that they are uncharacteristic and are isolated events. These tendencies keep the unfavorable perception of the out-group intact. One can imagine especially how such differential language can have longstanding and consequential impacts in particular given the extensive use of social media in the modern age, which allows for the rapid dissemination of language in large volumes.\nAccording to Maass et al. (1989), two main explanations for the underlying mechanism for the LIB are 1) in-group protection, and 2) differential expectancy.\nThe former is motivated and based loosely on Tajfel’s Social Identity Theory (SIT) - it hypothesises that the LIB serves to protect or enhance one’s social identity. A key element of the SIT is positive distinctiveness, i.e., the desire for members of a group to portray the in-group as not only different, but different in a positive way, from the out-group. The LIB can be considered a potential strategy of maintaining a positive light of one’s in-group.\nThe second explanation suggests that the LIB may be a result of differential expectancy - variations in a speaker’s expectations of the behaviours of the in-group and out-group. Abstract language may be preferred when behaviours confirm prior expectations, while concrete language is preferred when unexpected or surprising behaviours are observed. Hence, because individuals tend to expect more desirable behaviours from their in-group, they naturally utilize abstract language when referring to the positive behaviours, and concrete language when referring to the unexpected negative behaviours.\n\n\nQuantifying Intergroup Bias\nMeasures of psychological valence, i.e., measures of the positivity of words, have been a longtime tool in the assessment of intergroup bias. Schmidtke and Kuperman (2024) used corpus-based lexical estimates of valence to investigate bias in intergroup scenarios. Participants were assigned to either the “in-group” or “out-group” conditions and were given a set of “seed” words. In the “in-group” condition, participants were told that the seed words described their in-group, and were asked to provide three more words to describe their group. Those in the “out-group” condition were told that the seed words described an out-group, and were asked to provide three more words to describe that out-group. The intention of the experiment was to assess differences in valence in the words produced by participants of either group. To control the “ground truth,” the valence of the seed words were manipulated such that they ranged from highly positive to highly negative.\nIt was found, expectedly, that the valence of words directed towards the in-group was higher than that of words directed at the out-group. With regards to the seed “ground truth” valence, it was found that evaluations about the out-group were much closer to the seed valence, while evaluations about the in-group were consistently inflated. Furthermore, the magnitude of inflation from the “ground truth” tended to be larger when the valence of the seed words were more negative, suggesting that there is an implicit tendency to dissociate one’s in-group from negative characterizations.\nAs an extension to their first experiment, Schmidtke and Kuperman (2024) also examined the propagation of intergroup bias throughout successive generations. Using the linear difusion chain paradigm (which feeds responses of one generation to a next generation, who is given the same task, in this case of providing additional words based on seed words and group membership), it was found that there was a gradual increase in positivity in successive in-group generations, and a gradual decline in positivity in successive out-group generations. In short, intergroup bias is amplified across generations. As in the former experiment, the valence of the seed words did impact the magnitude of amplicifcation. For evaluations directed at the in-group, the positive inflation of generation was significant when the seed words were of low and mid valence, but not of high valence. For evaluations of directed at the out-group, the negative effect of generation was significant when the seed words were of mid and high valence, but not of low valence. Examination of the actual slopes of each model indicated that the desire to enhance initially negative descriptions of the in-group are stronger than the desire to derogate negative traits of the out-group.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nMaass, Anne, Daniela Salvi, Luciano Arcuri, and Gün R.
