### Hi, I'm Jasmine! Welcome to my personal encyclopedia!

I love learning - so, this is my personal encyclopedia - **a repository of knowledge**, if you will - where I store writeups of topics I am interested in, ranging from psychology to computer science to paleontology. I'll probably only be brushing the surface of these areas, but hey, any learning is fun and any knowledge is powerful.

#### My favorite writeups...
* [The Science of People: Cues, Charisma, and Making People Like You](topics/notes/01_the_science_of_people.qmd)
