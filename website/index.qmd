### Hi, I'm Jasmine! Welcome!

I love learning - so, this is my personal encyclopedia - **a repository of knowledge**, if you will - where I store writeups of topics I am interested in, ranging from psychology to computer science to paleontology. 

This is a more tech-y and accessible continuation of a trend I started way back in grade school, during which I kept a thick notebook covered in a floral pattern, filled with handwritten writeups of miscellaneous topics (I still have it!). I used to keep that notebook secret because I thought it would make me look too nerdy, but I'm at a point in life where I'm more than happy to embrace and share my nerdiness. So, welcome to my encyclopedia!
