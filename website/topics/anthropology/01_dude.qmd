### Introduction
Some may view slang terms as inexpressive and inarticulate additions to discourse. Such terms include the word "*dude*," which rose in popularity amongst young men in the 1980s and has seen its usage not just retained but expanded to become a general address term used by (and to) both men and women. Interestingly, however, studies of such words have found their usage to be constrained - as in, they have specific purposes in interaction, which have in turn augmented their rise in popularity.

A stereotypical, misconceived view of the use of "*dude*" from the "*Zits*" comic strip in 2001:

Think about the circumstances in which *you* use the word "*dude*." How often do you use "*dude*"? What kind of person - e.g., a family member, a friend, a romantic partner, a stranger, a boss - are you likely to be speaking to when you use "*dude*"? Do you think your gender identity, as well as that of the person you are speaking to, matters in your usage of "*dude*"?

You may realize that your usage of "*dude*" encodes your stance with the addressee(s).
