  * Etymology Nerd's article [Algorithms are making political speech more extreme](https://www.usermag.co/p/algorithms-are-making-political-speech?utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true)
* Idiolects - the speech habits that are unique to specific people based on their own life experiences (education, sociological and geographical upbringing, etc.)
  * Inspired by this short article by The Etymology Nerd: [how to catch a gubernatorial candidate, or a domestic terrorist](https://etymology.substack.com/p/how-to-catch-a-gubernatorial-candidate?r=3uxy8z&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true)

  * Nero

### Astronomy
* Olbers' Paradox
  * Why is the sky dark at night? Via [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/Olbers-paradox): "If the universe is endless and uniformly populated with luminous stars, then every line of sight must eventually terminate at the surface of a star. Hence, contrary to observation, this argument implies that the night sky should everywhere be bright, with no dark spaces between the stars."

### Marine Science
* Series of deep sea creatures
  * Giant Pacific Octopus
  * Colossal Squid
* Extinction of the megalodon - proof that it is truly extinct

### Philosophy
* The Simulation Argument - are we living in a simulation?
  * Via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis): "In 2001, philosopher Nick Bostrom proposed the simulation argument, which suggests that if a civilization becomes capable of creating conscious simulations, it could generate so many simulated beings that a randomly chosen conscious entity would almost certainly be in a simulation. The argument presents a trilemma: either such simulations are not created due to technological limitations or self-destruction; or advanced civilizations choose not to create them; or we are almost certainly living in one. This assumes that consciousness is not uniquely tied to biological brains but can arise from any system that implements the right computational structures and processes."

### Paleontology
* Tiktaalik and transition fossils
  * The evolution from swimming fish to four-legged vertebrates

### Reviews
*Doesn't quite fit the theme of an encyclopedia I suppose, but I'd enjoy writing up movie and book reviews here as well.*
* Movies (movies I've watched that would be valuable to interpret):
  * Get Out (2017)
  * Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (2000)
